# CHAPTER 01

## Getting started: A Quick Dip

Kotlin is making waves.

From its first release, Kotlin has impressed programmers with its friendly syntax, conciseness, flexibility and power. In this book, we'll teah your how to build your own Kotlin applications, and we'll start by getting you to build a basic application and run it. Along the way, you'll be introduced to some of Kotlin's basic syntax, such as statements, loops and conditional branching. Your journey has just begun ...

## Welcome to Kotlinville

Kotlin has been taking the programming world by storm. Despite being one of the youngest programming languages in town, many developers now view it as their language of choice. So what makes Kotlin is special?

Kotlin has many morden language features that mekt it attractive to developers. You'll find out about these features in more detaul later in the book, but for now, here aer some of the highlights.

### It's crisp, concise and readable

Unlike some languages, Kotlin code is very concise, and you can perform powerful tasks in just one line. It provides shortcuts for common actions so that you don't have to write lots of repetitive boilerplate code, and it has a rich library of functions that you can use. And as there's less code to wade through, it's quicker to read, write and understand, leaving you more time to do other things.

### You can use object-oriented AND functional programming

Can't decide whether to learn object-oriented or functional programming? Well, why not do both? Kotlin lets you create object-oriented code that use classes, inheritance and polymorphism, just as you can in Java. But it also supports functional programming, giving you the best of both worlds.

### The compiler keeps you safe

Nobody likes unsafe, buggy code, and Kotlin's compiler puts a lot of effect into making sure your code is as clean as possible, preventing many of the errors that can occur in other programming languages. Kotlin is statically typed, for example, so you can't perform inappropriate actions on the wrong tyoe of variable and crash your code. And most of the time, you don't even need to explicitlt specify the type yourself as the compiler can infer it for you.

So Kotlin is a morden, powerful and flexible programming language that offers many advantages. But that's not the end of the story.

## You can use Kotlin nearly everywhere

Kotlin is so powerful and flexible that you can use it as a general-purpose language in many different contexts. This is because you can choose which platform to compile your Kotlin code against.

### Java Virtual Machines (JVMs)

Kotlin code can be compiled to JVM (Java Virtual Machine) bytecode, so you can use Kotlin practically anywhere that you can use Java. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so you can use existing Java libraries with it. If you're working on an application that contains a lot of old Java code, you don't have to throw all the old code away; your new Kotlin code will work alongside it. And if you want to use the Kotlin code you've written from inside Java, you can do so with ease.

### Android

Alongside other languages such as Java, Kotlin has first-class support for Android, Kotlin is fully supported in Android Studio, and you can make the most of Kotlin's many advantages when you develop Android apps.

### Client-side and server-side JavaScript

You can also transpile or translate and compile Kotlin code into JavaScript, so that you can run it in a browser. You can use it to work with both client-side and server-side technology, such as WebGL or Node.js

### Native apps

If you want to write code that will run quickly on less powerful devices, you can compile your Kotlin code directly to native machine code. Thif allows you to write code that will run, for example, on iOS or Linux.

In this book, we're going to focus on creating Kotlin applications for JVMs, as this is the most straightforward way of getting to grips with the language. Afterwards, you'll be able to apply the knowledge you've gained to other platforms.

Let's dive in.

## What we'll do in this chapter

In this chapter, we're going to show you how to build a basic Kotlin application. There are a number of step we're going to go through to do this:

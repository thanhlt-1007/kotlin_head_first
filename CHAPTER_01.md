# CHAPTER 01

## Getting started: A Quick Dip

Kotlin is making waves.

From its first release, Kotlin has impressed programmers with its friendly syntax, conciseness, flexibility and power. In this book, we'll teah your how to build your own Kotlin applications, and we'll start by getting you to build a basic application and run it. Along the way, you'll be introduced to some of Kotlin's basic syntax, such as statements, loops and conditional branching. Your journey has just begun ...

## Welcome to Kotlinville

Kotlin has been taking the programming world by storm. Despite being one of the youngest programming languages in town, many developers now view it as their language of choice. So what makes Kotlin is special?

Kotlin has many morden language features that mekt it attractive to developers. You'll find out about these features in more detaul later in the book, but for now, here aer some of the highlights.

### It's crisp, concise and readable

Unlike some languages, Kotlin code is very concise, and you can perform powerful tasks in just one line. It provides shortcuts for common actions so that you don't have to write lots of repetitive boilerplate code, and it has a rich library of functions that you can use. And as there's less code to wade through, it's quicker to read, write and understand, leaving you more time to do other things.

### You can use object-oriented AND functional programming

Can't decide whether to learn object-oriented or functional programming? Well, why not do both? Kotlin lets you create object-oriented code that use classes, inheritance and polymorphism, just as you can in Java. But it also supports functional programming, giving you the best of both worlds.

### The compiler keeps you safe

Nobody likes unsafe, buggy code, and Kotlin's compiler puts a lot of effect into making sure your code is as clean as possible, preventing many of the errors that can occur in other programming languages. Kotlin is statically typed, for example, so you can't perform inappropriate actions on the wrong tyoe of variable and crash your code. And most of the time, you don't even need to explicitlt specify the type yourself as the compiler can infer it for you.

So Kotlin is a morden, powerful and flexible programming language that offers many advantages. But that's not the end of the story.

## You can use Kotlin nearly everywhere

Kotlin is so powerful and flexible that you can use it as a general-purpose language in many different contexts. This is because you can choose which platform to compile your Kotlin code against.

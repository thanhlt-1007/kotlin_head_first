# TABLE OF CONTENTS (THE REAL THING)

## How to use this book: Intro

Your brain on Kotlin.

Here you are trying to learn something, while here your brain is, doing you a favor by making sure the learning the learning doesn't stick. Your brain's thinking, "Better leave room for more important things, like which wild animals to avoid and whether naked snowboarding is a a bad iddea." So how do you trick your brain into thinking that your life depends on knowing how to code in Kotlin?

## Chapter 1

Kotlin is making waves.

From its first release, Kotlin has impressed programmers with its friendly syntaxm conciseness, flexibility and power. In this book, we'll teach you how to build your own Kotlin applications, and we'll start by getting you to build a basic application and run it. Along the way. you'll be introduced to some of Kotlin's basic syntax, such as statements, loops and conditional branching. Your journey has just begun ...

## Chapter 2

There's one thing all code depends on - variables.

So in this chapter, we're going to look under the hood, and show you how Kotlin variables really work. You'll discover Kotlin's basic types, such as Ints, Floats and Booleans, and learn how the Kotlin compiler can cleverly infer a variable's type from the value it's given. You'll find out how to use String templates to construct complex Strings with very little code, and you'll learn how to create arrays to hold multiple values. Finally, you'll discover why objects are so important to life in Kotlinville.

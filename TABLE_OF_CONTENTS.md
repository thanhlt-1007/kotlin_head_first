# TABLE OF CONTENTS (THE REAL THING)

## How to use this book: Intro

Your brain on Kotlin.

Here you are trying to learn something, while here your brain is, doing you a favor by making sure the learning the learning doesn't stick. Your brain's thinking, "Better leave room for more important things, like which wild animals to avoid and whether naked snowboarding is a a bad iddea." So how do you trick your brain into thinking that your life depends on knowing how to code in Kotlin?

## Chapter 1

Kotlin is making waves.

From its first release, Kotlin has impressed programmers with its friendly syntaxm conciseness, flexibility and power. In this book, we'll teach you how to build your own Kotlin applications, and we'll start by getting you to build a basic application and run it. Along the way. you'll be introduced to some of Kotlin's basic syntax, such as statements, loops and conditional branching. Your journey has just begun ...

## Chapter 2

There's one thing all code depends on - variables.

So in this chapter, we're going to look under the hood, and show you how Kotlin variables really work. You'll discover Kotlin's basic types, such as Ints, Floats and Booleans, and learn how the Kotlin compiler can cleverly infer a variable's type from the value it's given. You'll find out how to use String templates to construct complex Strings with very little code, and you'll learn how to create arrays to hold multiple values. Finally, you'll discover why objects are so important to life in Kotlinville.

- "What happens when you declare a variable"

- "Assigning a value to another variable"

- "We need to convert the value"

- "What happens when you convert a value"

- "Watch out for overspill"

- "Store multiple values in an array"

- "Create the PhraseOMatic.kt"

- "The compiler infers the array's type from its values"

- "var means the variable can point to a different array"

- "val means the variable points to the same array forever..."

- "Puzzle Mixed References"

## Chapter 3

It's time to take it up a notch, and learn about functions.

So far, all the code you've written has been inside your appliaction's main function. But if you want to write code that's better organized and easier to maintain, you need to know how to split your code into separate functions. In thif chapter, you'll learn how to write functions an interact with your application bu building a game. You'll discover how to write compact single expression functions. Along the way you'll find out how to interate through ranges and collections using the powerful for loop.

## Chapter 4

It's time we looked beyond Kotlin's basic types.

Sooner or later, you're going to want to use something more than Kotlin's basic types. And that's where classes come in. Classes are templates that allow you to create your own types of objects, and define their properties and functions. Here, you'll learn how to design and define classes, and how to use them to create new types of objects. You'll meet constructor, initializer blocks, getter and setters, and you'll discover how they can be used to protect your properties. Finally, you'll learn how data hiding is built into all Kotlin code, saving you time, effort and a multitude of keystrokes.

## Chapter 5

Ever found yourself thinking that an object's type would be perfect if you could just change a few thing?

Well, that's one of the advantages of inheritance. Here, you'll learn how to create subclasses, and inherit the properties and functions of a superclass. You'll discover h∆° to override functions and properties to make your classes behave the way you want, and you'll find out wjen this is (and isn't) appropriate. Finally, you'll see how inheritance helps you avoid duplicated code, and how to improve your flexibility with polymorphism.
